# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Unclear Error Message

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered when using the `expo prebuild` command in an Expo managed workflow project. The build process fails with an unclear error message, preventing successful release builds. The project works correctly in development mode. Various troubleshooting steps, such as clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies, did not resolve the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.

The `expo prebuild` command is expected to successfully prepare the project for a release build. However, it instead fails without providing a helpful error message.  The `bug.js` file contains the relevant project code which demonstrates the issue.

## Solution

The solution was found to be related to a specific dependency.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution. This may also be a platform specific issue, requiring further investigation into the build logs.
