While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command. The error message was quite generic, and the solution wasn't immediately obvious.  The build process would fail without providing much detail about the root cause. My project structure was standard, and I had followed the Expo documentation closely. I tried several solutions, including cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and updating Expo CLI, but the problem persisted. The project would run on a simulator or emulator, however building for release would invariably fail.
