// bugSolution.js
// This file demonstrates the solution to the problem.
// The solution often involves identifying and addressing specific dependency conflicts or platform-specific build issues.
// For example, check your dependencies for any known compatibility issues with Expo's release build process.
// Carefully analyze the full build logs to search for clues related to the failure. Look for any specific errors or warnings.
// The log may reveal incompatibility with a particular library, platform-specific build issues, or even problems with the version of node that is used to perform the build. 
// In some cases, downgrading or upgrading a specific dependency can resolve the issue.
// Consider using a newer or older version of a specific package.
// If all else fails, create a new, minimal Expo project to test if the issue is specific to your project or is instead a more systemic problem.
